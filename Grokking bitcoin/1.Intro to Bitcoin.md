### What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a digital cash system. It allows for people to move bitcoins, the currency unit of Bitcoin, between each other without using a bank or any other trusted third party. It resembles traditional bank notes and coins, but it’s purely digital and used over the internet. The Bitcoin currency isn’t tied to any specific _fiat currency_ like the US dollar or the Chinese renminbi; it has free-floating exchange rates against most fiat currencies. You can buy and sell bitcoins for fiat currencies online using one of several exchanges, such as kraken.com, bitstamp.net, or localbitcoins.com.

No government or company controls Bitcoin. Instead, thousands of computers around the globe—the _Bitcoin network_, shown in [Figure 1](https://rosenbaum.se/book/grokking-bitcoin-1.html#actors)—collectively keep the system working 24/7. You don’t need to register or sign up anywhere to use Bitcoin, you just need internet access and a computer program, like a mobile app, to use it.

# Transactions

Transaction

A _transaction_ is a _payment_. The terms are interchangeable. We cover transactions in [[ch05]](https://rosenbaum.se/book/grokking-bitcoin-1.html#ch05) and [[ch09]](https://rosenbaum.se/book/grokking-bitcoin-1.html#ch09).

Step 1 of the process is when Alice asks the network to move 1 bitcoin to Bob. She does this by sending a Bitcoin transaction to the Bitcoin network. This transaction contains instructions on how to move the money and a digital signature that proves it’s really Alice requesting that the money be moved.

The Bitcoin _transaction_ is a piece of data specifying

- The amount to move (1 bitcoin)
- The Bitcoin address to move the money to (Bob’s Bitcoin address, `15vwoaN74MBeF5nr2BH4DKqndEFjHA6MzT`)
- A _digital signature_ (made with Alice’s private key)

## what is bitcoin blockchain?

The Bitcoin blockchain is a database that each computer in the Bitcoin network has a copy of. Think of the blockchain as a ledger/record of all transactions ever made.

---

To coordinate the ordering of transactions, one node takes the lead, saying “I want to add these two transactions to the blockchain in the order Y, X!” This message, known as a _block_, is sent out on the network by that leader ([Figure 6](https://rosenbaum.se/book/grokking-bitcoin-1.html#step-3)), in the same way that Alice sent the transaction.

![01 06](https://rosenbaum.se/book/images/ch01/01-06.svg)

Figure 6. One node takes the lead and tells the others in what order to add transactions. The other nodes verify the block and update their blockchain copies accordingly.

**The blockchain is append-only**
**New transactions are added to the end of the blockchain only—it grows only from the end.**

As nodes see this block, they update their copy of the blockchain according to the message and pass the block on to their peers. Alice’s transaction was one of the transactions in the block and is now part of the blockchain.

Why would a node want to take the lead? The node that takes the lead is rewarded with newly minted bitcoins and transaction fees paid by the transactions it includes in the block.

But wouldn’t every node constantly take the lead to collect the rewards? No, because to take the lead, a node must solve a hard problem. This requires the node to consume considerable time and electricity, which ensures that leaders don’t pop up often. The problem is so hard that most nodes in the network don’t even try. Nodes that do try are called _miners_ because they mine new coins, similar to a gold miner digging for gold.

# How is Bitcoin valued?

As you read in the [Section 1.5.4](https://rosenbaum.se/book/grokking-bitcoin-1.html#speculation), a bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically. But where does this price come from? Several Bitcoin exchanges exist, most of them internet-based. They resemble stock markets, where users wanting to sell bitcoins are matched with users wanting to buy bitcoins.

Different markets can have different market prices depending on the supply and demand in that market. For example, in countries such as Venezuela, where the government tries to hinder the Bitcoin market, the supply is low. But the demand is high because people want to escape their hyperinflating currency. These factors drive the Bitcoin price up in that market compared to, for example, the US and European markets, where people can trade more freely.


### Feasibility of different fee levels

| Amount to transfer | Fee       | Fee % | Feasible     |
| ------------------ | --------- | ----- | ------------ |
| 2 BTC              | 0.003 BTC | 0.15% | Yes          |
| 0.002 BTC          | 0.001 BTC | 50%   | Probably not |
| 0.001 BTC          | 0.005 BTC | 500%  | No           |

## Digital signatures

![u02 11](https://rosenbaum.se/book/images/ch02/u02-11.svg)

In this section, we explore how you can prove to someone that you approve a payment. To do that, we use _digital signatures_. A digital signature is a digital equivalent of a handwritten signature. The difference is that a handwritten signature is tied to a person, whereas a digital signature is tied to a random number called a _private key_. A digital signature is much harder to forge than a handwritten signature.

# Summary

- Bitcoin is global, borderless money that anyone with an internet connection can use.
- Many different actors use Bitcoin, including savers, merchants, and traders for various purposes, such as payments, remittances, and savings.
- A network of computers, the Bitcoin network, verifies and keeps records of all payments.
- A transaction goes through the following steps: send transaction, verify transaction, add transaction to the blockchain, and notify the recipient and sender wallets.
- Bitcoin solves problems with inflation, borders, segregation, and privacy by providing limited supply, decentralization, and borderlessness.
- Several alternative cryptocurrencies exist apart from Bitcoin, such as Ethereum, Zcash, and Namecoin.
- A (crypto)currency becomes more useful as more users use it. This is called the network effect.
