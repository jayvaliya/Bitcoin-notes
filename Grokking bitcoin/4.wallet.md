## Generating a mnemonic sentence
The encoding starts with the random number, as shown in [Figure 15](#fig0415). The random number is hashed with SHA256, and the first 4 bits of the hash—in this case, `0111`—are appended to the random number. Those 4 bits act as a checksum. You then arrange the bits into 12 groups of 11 bits, where each group encodes a number in the range 0 to 2047. Eleven bits can encode 211 = 2,048 different values, remember?
