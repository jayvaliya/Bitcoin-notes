## What is decentralization?


## Type of decentralization

1. **Architectural decentralization**
    
    - This relates to the physical infrastructure—the number and distribution of computers or nodes that support the system.
    - A system is architecturally decentralized when there's no single infrastructural point of failure.
2. **Political decentralization**
    
    - This refers to who holds power or control—whether decisions are made by many individuals or a single authority.
    - Vitalik notes that blockchains are politically decentralized (no one entity controls them)
    
3. **Logical decentralization**
    
    - This pertains to how the system behaves and processes data. Does it function like a single unified computer, or is logic itself distributed?
    - Despite being architecturally and politically decentralized, most blockchains are logically centralized—they maintain a single agreed-upon state and act like one computer.
